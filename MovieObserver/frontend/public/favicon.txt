// Instructions for setting up a basic favicon:
// 1. Create favicon.ico file (a simple one)
// 2. Place it in the public folder
// 3. These instructions exist as a placeholder for a real favicon
//    In a real project, you would need to generate proper favicon files
//    using tools like https://realfavicongenerator.net/
